description = "A mod that improves the options menu.

[list]
[*] Improved Video tooltips based on [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/hvt9xy/vermintide_2_graphics_setting_guide/] Vermintide 2 Graphics Setting Guide [/url]
    [list]
    [*] Removed redundant Extreme options
    [*] Changed some options to better reflect what they do (i.e. Changing Low to Off)
    [/list]
[*] New Video Presets that balance the look of the game with performance:
    [list]
    [*] Potato: Potato Settings set out by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1265070978] Beyond Low Graphics (Potato Mode) [+FPS] [/url] (you will need to modify atlas sizes in config.)
    [*] Bad CPU: Recomended Settings but lowered settings that impact CPU and lowered more intensive GPU settings.
    [*] Balanced: Recomended Settings for a good experience.
    [*] Balanced +: Recomended Settings for a good experience with some options being increased that don't have a big performance impact.
    [*] Can It Run The Tide: Peddal to the Metal, all settings max, but actually reasonable with no motion blur. i.e. Can It Run Crysis.
    [/list]
[/list]

Note: So you can use the new presets in Official Realm, the mod will automatically change the preset to Custom when you exit the options menu, don't be alarmed by this.
